My research interests are in developing and applying causal inference methods
to studying social and contextual influences on mental health and substance
use in disadvantaged, urban areas of the United States. Current methodological
interests are 1) estimating mediation pathways and 2) predicting effects
transported from a source population to a new, target population. Current
substantive interests are mental health and substance use in adolescents,
contextual drivers of violence, and studying interventions aimed at altering
these contextual factors.

I'm currently working with:

- [Mark van der Laan](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~laan/) in developing targeted minimum loss-based estimators for transporting encouragement design interventions across sites estimating mediation effects.
- [Ivàn Dìaz](https://www.idiaz.xyz/) in developing more flexible estimators of mediation effects.
- [Jen Ahern](http://sph.berkeley.edu/jennifer-ahern) and [Maria Glymour](http://profiles.ucsf.edu/maria.glymour) on applying these estimators to understanding site variability in policy and program effects.
- [Magdalena Cerdá](https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/magdalena-cerda) on understanding the health effects of substance use policies and the risk landscape of the opioid epidemic.
- [Liz Stuart](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~estuart/) on a smattering of other causal inference projects.
