Kara Rudolph is an Assistant Professor in Mailman School of Public Health at
Columbia University in New York.

Her current work, funded by a NIDA K99/R00, is developing methods to transport
mediation effects from one population to another and apply them to understand
how school characteristics mediate relationships between neighborhood factors
and adolescent drug use.

I graduated with a PhD (Epidemiology) and MHS (Biostatistics) from the Johns
Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in 2014. Here is my CV. Code from
some of my research is on Github.
