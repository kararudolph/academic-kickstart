I am an epidemiologist with research interests in developing and applying
causal inference methods to understand social and contextual influences on
mental health, substance use, and violence in disadvantaged, urban areas of
the United States.

My current work focuses on developing methods for transportability and
mediation, and subsequently applying those methods to understand how aspects
of the school and peer environments mediate relationships between neighborhood
factors and adolescent drug use across populations. More generally, my work on
generalizing/ transporting findings from study samples to target populations
and identifying subpopulations most likely to benefit from interventions
contributes to efforts to optimally target available policy and program
resources.

I completed a PhD in Epidemiology and an MHS in Biostatistics from the Johns
Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and was a Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation Health and Society Scholar.
